# SCENZ ArcGIS JavaScriptAPI4 App

This app is a very simple version of a SCENZ web app to test using and interacting with the NIWA-SCENZ Image Services in the web. 

Before, apps have been used that were based off of ArcGIS WebAppBuilder Developer Edition - which uses Esri's JavaScriptAPI3 and has been announced 'to be retired' in 2024. ArcGIS Experience Builder, the designated successor for WebAppBuilder, which does work with the ArcGIS JavaScriptAPI4, currently has no widgets that are useful with ArcGIS Image Services, such as those used in SCENZ.

In order to have a future development path, this app is an attempt to implement the most important functionality in ArcGIS JavaScript SDK V4 directly. For the time being, it is a proof-of-concept and does not attempt to include all the existing functionality and documentation of https://gis.niwa.co.nz/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/?id=9794f29cd417493894df99d422c30ec2&page=page_3
